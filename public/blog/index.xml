      <description>Python for Beginners At the beginning, Python is overwhelming and it still is. But it has been important to understand the fundamentals before tackling bigger concepts. By understanding the basics of Python, you will be able to explore all different kinds of coding.
Let’s see how we can use the library called reticulate to use Python code in RStudio! Yes, it is possible to use Python codes in RStudio and vice versa.</description>

      <description>Sequence Aligning Global sequence alignment was one of the last concepts that we covered in Python and it was one of my favorite. The significance of global sequence alignment is that it is mainly used to demonstrate the highly conserved regions of protein alignment. It is known that when a sequence is highly conserved then it has important evolutionary properties for the survival of said organism.
 The NeedleMan-Wusch Algorithm This is the algorithm used in bioinformatics in order to align proteins and give a proper scoring system.</description>

      <description>Pyhton - The Software  A few months prior to this class, a friend of mine was talking about registering for a neuroscience class that was python based and me never having had computer science experience, I had no idea what he was talking about. My first thought was python the snake… Yeah, I know… So, that was the first thing that I blurted out; “Oh, like the snake?” I am very surprised our friendship didn’t end right then and there.</description>
